Dupont ROE Analysis / DuPont Identity

I took a hit in the accounting class the introduced me to DuPont return on equity analysis.  I was hooked and startred building this spreadsheet to automate analysis from publicly available balance sheet and income statement data that is published for all publicly traded companies.  Building this spreadsheet cost me a letter grade in that class becasue I had to forgo some of my homework to work on it.
